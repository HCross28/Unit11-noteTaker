# Unit11-noteTaker

Ooooooh Boy... 
Where do I even begin. 
This project sounded easy enough, however once I had opened the project files given to us in the "public" folder, I was immediately confused. There is an index.js file already given to us, with what looks like all the functionality to run the app. What was I to code? 
Looking through it, it appears that all we need is the routing code (to send the user from one page to the other) and code that assigns a PORT # and gets the app to listen to the aforementioned port. 

I coded this to the best of my knowledge. Unfortunately I cannot get Heroku to take my app. Enclosed in the folder 
"Error Messages (A Tribute To My Conundrum)" I have enclosed two screenshots showing my terminal error messages and an error message I got back by trying to manually move the files to Heroku from my GitHub. Neither endeavor worked. 

With the inability to get my app on Heroku... I can't test the code I wrote. Naturally I already know my code doesn't work, but the trial and error process has always been my go to. 

At this point I'm totally lost in the weeds, and frustrated over the fact that another week will go by with me submitting horrible code that doesn't even work. 

I'm sorry to have wasted your time this week.
